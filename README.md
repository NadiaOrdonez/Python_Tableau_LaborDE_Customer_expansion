# Python_Tableau_LaborDE_Customer_expansion
This repository showcases Python syntax for data analytics (using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `os`), visualization (`matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `scipy`), machine learning (`sklearn`), and forecasting (`statsmodels.api`) in Jupyter Notebook within Anaconda. Focused on enhancing their already successful business, LaborDE, a prominent laboratory supplier based in Nordrhein-Westphalia (NRW), Germany aims to expand their customer base not only in their stronghold of NRW but also for exploring new market opportunities in other Bundesl채nder.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
In 2019, the German NGO [Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V.](https://okfn.de/) and the British NGO [opencorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) collaborated to release German Trade Register data via [OffeneRegister.de](https://offeneregister.de/), offering a comprehensive list of over 5 million companies to the public. Recognizing the strategic value of this data, LaborDE aims to leverage it for identifying potential laboratory and cancer company customers in Germany.
### Objective
Address business questions posed by the LaborDE Management Board, to expand their customer base. 
#### National Landscape - Bundesland
* What is the nationwide distribution of potential customer companies specializing in laboratory diagnostics, and which Bundesl채nder has the highest concentration of potential customers?
* What is the prevalence of companies offering diagnostic services specifically for cancer, and where are they situated in Germany?
#### Regional Focus - NRW
* What is the distribution of potential customer companies specializing in laboratory diagnostics across NRW, and which regions exhibit the highest concentration?
* What is the extent of the customer base served by laboratory diagnostic companies in NRW in terms of male and female population?.  
### Scope
The analysis will encompass both national (Bundesl채nder) and regional (NRW) levels for customer base expansion.
## Dataframes overview
* The [German company dataset](https://offeneregister.de/) compiled by [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) primarily between June 2017 and January 2019, contains basic information on over 5 million German companies.
* The demographic and financial datasets for each Bundesland and region was sourced from diverse German public websites, please refer to the [Project brief](01_2024_LaborDE_analysis/01_Project_Management/Project_brief.pdf) for details.
* The spatial data corresponded to [Bundesland](https://github.com/isellsoap/deutschlandGeoJSON/blob/main/README.md) and [regional](https://www.suche-postleitzahl.org/plz-karte-erstellen) levels and was used in Python and Tableau to create maps.

## Tableau visuals
After conducting data analysis and running machine learning models, I utilized Tableau to create compelling visualizations that not only illustrate our findings but also provide robust support for the recommendations outlined in the customer base expansion plan. Within Tableau, I seamlessly integrated individual graphs using dashboards and story features for a comprehensive presentation. Use this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nadia.ordonez/viz/GermancompaniesLaborDE/LaborDECustomerexpansion) to access the dashboard.

## Data-driven recommendations for Customer base expansion 
Stakekholders are informed about our main Python findings in the [Word report](). The below recommendations are supported by our data analysis process.
* _Optimized Ad Scheduling:_ To enhance the effectiveness of our targeted marketing campaign, consider scheduling ads during periods with lower order volumes. The analysis indicates that Wednesdays and Thursdays between 23:00 and 06:00 experience the fewest orders on our app.
* _Strategic Advertising Timing:_ Capitalize on peak user activity and spending by focusing product advertising between 09:00 and 16:00. During these hours, our users spend each hour over 17 million dollars. Aligning marketing efforts with this active period can maximize engagement and sales.
* _Product Pricing:_ Emphasize mid-range products priced between 5 and 15 dollars, as these have proven to be the most popular among our users.
* _Targeted Grocery Department Promotion:_ Acknowledge the popularity of certain grocery departments, such as produce, dairy eggs, snacks, beverages, and frozen items, where over 2 million products are ordered in each category. Consider intensifying promotions in these areas or strategizing to boost the visibility of other departments.
* _Demographic and Regional Insights_:
  * Launch a loyalty program targeting customers who currently contribute to 33.8% of all app sales. On average, these loyal customers place orders once a week, presenting an opportunity to foster continued engagement and loyalty.
  * Recognize that customers across all US regions and family statuses exhibit similar app usage frequencies, placing orders every 10 to 11 days on average. However, note that married customers, particularly those older than 40, exhibit higher spending power, contributing to sales exceeding 160 million dollars in our current database. Consider refining marketing approaches to capitalize on these trends.
  * Our top 3 customer profiles are from a middle-income, encompassing adults with and without kids, and retirees with kids. Here in particular, the customer profile "Adult with kids and middle income" standouts, by surpassing 10 million counts and contributing over $90 million to our total sales of $163 millions. Despite a slightly less frequent ordering pattern, our top 3 profiles exhibit prevalence nationwide, with the Southern states leading in customer counts. To amplify engagement with our key customer base, a targeted marketing campaign focusing on the "Adult with kids and middle income" group is crucial. Tailoring messages and promotions to meet their preferences can further enhance our market share.                                                                                                     
## Project timeline
